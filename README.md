# Openshift Pipelines

Repository dedicated to the creation of pipelines hosted on Openshift. Each directory represents an Openshift version and inside each one there is a different implementation based on the Openshift technology. For example: in directory `v3.11` there is a pipeline implemented using Groovy and Jenkins techniques but in branch `v4.5` the implementation is based on Tekton.
